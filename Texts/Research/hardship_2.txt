[b]Introduction[/b]

Microcolonial black fungi are a diverse group of slow-grow- ing decay that pose three major advances while colonising a certain territory: esthetic, biophysical, and biochemical biodeterioration (1-3). The species usually displays high re- sistance to various extreme environmental conditions, being considered one of the most resistant groups of eukaryotic organisms (4). What extremely enhances the mould’s abil- ity to inhabit adverse conditions, is an unmatched level of precision with which the fungi calculates and predicts how a foreign material operates as a host environment for the colony. Such behaviour was well observed in the case of inhabitation of The Sistine Chapel Ceiling, Volume Two, as the colony detected damp plasterboards attached to the ceiling of the DobraVaga Gallery, Ljubljana (5). Recently, the strain of Alternaria (ED 567-987) was isolated from the biodeteriorated plasterboard to prove the colony’s ability to migrate beyond its borders and establish stable living condi- tions within the human carrier apparatus-the sole method presently acknowledged to be able to accommodate mould beyond its original territory.
