[b]Conclusion[/b]

While individual human bodies have been studied and re- ported to display substantial black mould vegetation, a more sudden and extensive fungal bloom would be needed for the species to truly colonise the environment of the hosting subject. Concurrently, sufficient terrain coverage is required for Alternaria to develop discernable properties that can be analysed and consequently contribute to potentially extend- ed understanding of current affairs in heritage protection outside of the colonyâ€™s initial territory.
