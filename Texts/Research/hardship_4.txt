[b]Effects of Unstable Growing Environment on Alternar- ia Spore Development and its General Prosperity[/b]

Persuasive causality between hosts acute, sub-acute or chronic malpractice and expedient decay of sporangia have been recorded and continue to play an important role in malpractices in black mould maintenance despite obvious correlation determined with dust sample analysis. It goes as follows: Primary unsuitability of the host can be over- looked due to its high initial excitement and momentum. These two factors can disguise general adverse conditions for both parties for up to two years before most individu- al units carrying IGA/GHM relocate to areas too far away from the main growth area and eventually sever ties with it to recuperate. One would suspect that presence of Alternar-

ia in the outskirts of its original location would enlarge the territory and therefore promote its presence and spread to other potential hosts but such dispersion usually impedes its development. Most common causes are the mould’s limited familiarity with new circumstances and the hosts temporary or permanent incapability of networking and organising that can advance to complete aversion. Where uncertainties in scientific knowledge exist, practical applications designed to be protective of Alternaria’s preservation are favoured and immediately enforced. Therefore, keepers or custodians of IGA/GHMs are expected to provide appropriate compen- sation (with option of appeal with sufficient documentation of impossibility to act otherwise). Such measures would strengthen the mycelium network and consequently inforce greater legitimacy of the Inhabitation Phase Two variant.
