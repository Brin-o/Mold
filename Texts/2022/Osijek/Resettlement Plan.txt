The General Secretariat of the  Institute for Mould Preservation, through its AMA (hereinafter referred to as the “SPREADER”) and the Museum of Fine Arts in Osijek  (hereinafter referred to as the “RECIPIENT”) have executed the attached Implementation Document pursuant to which certain species of the SPREADER detailed in the Implementation Document (hereinafter referred to in this Implementation Document as the “species”) will be spread at the Museum of Fine Arts in Osijek. The SPREADER warrants that it is the sole owner of the species covered by this document. 
The RECIPIENT understands and agrees to the following: 
The species covered by this document shall at all times be given sufficient care to protect them against loss, damage, and/or deterioration. The RECIPIENT shall maintain constant and adequate protection of the species from all hazards, including but not limited to: fire; water or humidity; insects; dirt; and theft; and from mishandling by unauthorized or inexperienced persons, or by the public. Should loss, damage, or deterioration be noted, regardless of who may be responsible, therefore, the RECIPIENT shall inform the SPREADER immediately and in detail. Should damage occur during transit, the RECIPIENT and the carrier shall be notified at once, and all packing materials shall be saved until all parties have had an opportunity to inspect them. 
The species shall be maintained in the condition in which they were received (e. g. always growing) by the SPREADER, as described in the Implementation Document. The species shall not be unframed or removed from mats, or mounts for any purpose whatsoever, or cleaned, repaired, retouched, or altered in any way, or transported in damaged condition except with the prior express written permission of the SPREADER. 
The species shall be packed and transported by a qualified company specializing in transporting mould, such as the species described in this Resettlement Agreement. All costs for packing and “door-to-door” round-trip transportation of the species shall be arranged for and shall be paid in full by the RECIPIENT. 
The SPREADER shall provide and pay for insurance coverage for the species with an insurer acceptable to the RECIPIENT under an all-risk “nail to nail” policy at the value specified in the Implementation Document. The RECIPIENT shall indemnify the SPREADER for any loss of or damage to the species while in the RECIPIENT’S possession as well as while in transit. 
The loan period may be extended only by mutual and written agreement of duly authorized representatives of the Parties. In the event of extension, the insurance coverage must be extended accordingly.
The species may be photographed and recorded as video, and these images reproduced for normal publicity, including internet publicity, educational purposes, and the exhibit catalogue before and during the exhibition covered by this Loan, and for condition records, but special permission from the SPREADER shall be obtained in writing for all other reproduction. Information about the species used for catalogues, labels, or any other purpose shall conform to the catalogue data furnished by the SPREADER and shall always include a credit line to “Institute for Mould Preservation” giving the name of the donor or purchase fund when specified. 
If any dispute arises between the Parties related in any way to the performance or interpretation of this Loan Agreement, or any other matter in connection with this Implementation Agreement which cannot be settled by amicable agreement, then upon either party’s giving written notice of the difference or dispute to the other, the dispute shall be resolved by submitting the matter for final and binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of procedure of the Commercial Arbitration Commission and the law of the District of The Sistine Chapel Ceiling. The language of the arbitral procedure shall be English, and the arbitration shall be held in Ljubljana, unless otherwise agreed by the Parties. Provided, however, that before a Party may take a dispute to arbitration, that Party shall first seek to resolve the dispute through mediation. When a dispute is taken to mediation, both Parties shall make a good faith effort to settle the dispute. 

The demand for arbitration shall be filed in writing with the other Party to this Agreement and with the Arbitration Association. The demand for arbitration shall be made within a reasonable time after the claim, dispute, or other matter in question has arisen. In no event shall the demand for arbitration be made after the date when the institution of legal or equitable proceedings based on such controversy, claim or dispute or other matters in question would be barred by the applicable statute of limitations under the laws of the District of The Sistine Chapel Ceiling, Volume Two. 

The law applicable to this Implementation Agreement is the law of the District of The Sistine Chapel Ceiling, Volume Two. 
(9) Nothing in this Implementation Agreement constitutes an express or implied waiver of the privileges or immunities of the GS/ IMP under international law or the laws of the EU. 

I agree to all of the Terms and Conditions Governing This Contract, as set forth above in this document, and I am duly authorized by my employer to sign this Agreement on behalf of the RECIPIENT.
