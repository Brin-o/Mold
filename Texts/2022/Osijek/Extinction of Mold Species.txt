[u]SCRIPT FOR THE OPENING SPEECH (with notes)[/u]

On behalf of the [u]Institute for Mould Preservation[/u] and the [u]Museum of Fine
Arts in Osijek[/u], thank you all for being here, for such a monumental event.
Now, this is the first successful attempt in the series of the seven
implementation processes of resettlement that we’ll feature within the
Institute throughout the next twenty-four months. Ladies and gentlemen, we give
you [i]…[/i] [u]The Mould Formation, Number Eleven[/u].[u][/u]

Every year, scores of species disappear into the oblivion of extinction, stamped out,
in one way or another, by us humans. Sadly, the year 2021 was no different. Two
years ago, the most reliable source of such information—the International Union
for Conservation of Nature’s Red List of Threatened Species—observed an act
thought to be irreversible. The walls of the [u]Museum of Fine Arts in Osijek[/u],
once inhabited by the marvellous fungi development of the species of [i]Alternaria[/i],
re-emerged as the opposite: white and untouched, completely erasing any trace
of the hyphae branches, living peacefully within the Institution’s foundations.
The irresponsible drop of humidity to the dangerous 50%, and the mindless
removal of the museum’s old piping system both took a toll on the Family’s
growth, causing loss that was thought to be never regained—the precious colony
of Mould, residing in this particular environment, seemed to have been extinct.[u][/u]

After these unfortunate events, I want you all to know one thing this evening: our
scientists have succeeded! We have finally grasped the procedure suitable for
artificial reintroduction of the Dynasty to its former territory. [i]How[/i],
you may be wondering? It is for sheer luck that a similar species fascinated
the crowds of Ljubljana. First kept as a highly confidential secret with its
code name, [u]The Sistine Chapel Ceiling, Volume Two, [/u]the site was finally
open to the public in 2022. Declared as A World Heritage Site by UNESCO, the
Institute for Mould Preservation has been proud to take care of these long-lost
communities of mould. Spreading through the ceiling of the DobraVaga Gallery,
the species has finally found the geopolitical territory to preserve its culture’s
vanishing traditions—the traditions we found urgent to deliver to the Museum of
Fine Arts in Osijek and will be ceremonially displayed and implemented tonight
as a newly acquired gift.[u][/u]

The teams of our researchers have carefully assessed the Museum’s facilities,
coming up with a grand solution. A simple device, known as the common
‘humidifier’, could bring the specified area back to its optimal conditions to
introduce a non-autochthonous population. The resettled descendants of the
motherly formation from DobraVaga might suffer stress caused by the new
environment and adaptation to it. Failure might have occurred during this phase
had we not discovered [u]The Mould Formation, Number 11[/u], and a secret it
carries. On the microbic level, researchers found the existence of a written
form of language that is currently being translated. The characters seem to
mimic the mould’s movement and formation trails, visible at the site, providing
scholars with the hypothesis that the entire colony eventually turns into a
Rune-like labyrinth, unveiling its message to the surroundings. This provides a
possible bridge for communication as we can artificially mimic the colony’s
settlement, enforcing the notion of trust in the foreign environment. 

 

 

[i]Distinguished
Guests, [/i]

[i]Now,
we have arrived at the pinnacle of our ceremony; the signing of our Agreement,
finally followed by the Resettlement Number One. [/i]

[i]The
Signee representing [u]The Institute for Mould Preservation[/u] is __________,
Member of the Management Board of the Institute and the Deputy dean of
research. [/i]

[i]Representing
the [u]Museum of Fine Arts in Osijek[/u] is Valentina Radoš, the senior curator
of this Museum. [/i]

[i]Please,
welcome both. [/i]

[i]Today’s
historic agreement is to be witnessed by everyone present.[/i]

Finally,
the moment has come: Ladies and Gentlemen, the Resettlement Number One.

We can almost feel a sensation of relief. To preserve such an important species
with all of its behavioural practices, knowing the possible tragedy that all of
this could suddenly go extinct. Preventing the colonies’ disappearance gets
simpler every day, as the fungi formations nicely and in a very hard-working
manner grow larger day by day, until the whole Museum is wonderfully filled
only with the humidity stains. [u]The Mould Formation, Number 11[/u]—as well as
its motherland, [u]The Sistine Chapel Ceiling, Volume Two[/u], thus are
becoming a priceless magic manuscript that can be read from the bottom up, from
the left, or from the right. Wherever you start, you’ll find yourself being
absorbed by the mould.
