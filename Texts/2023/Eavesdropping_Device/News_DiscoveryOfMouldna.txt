[i]“The rumours are flying, the implications extraordinary. Today’s detection of an unidentified Mould settlement can neither be confirmed nor denied. But the rumours leaked from an alleged conversation between scientists at the DobraVaga Gallery in Ljubljana reveal a potential discovery of the Mould species in a competitive environment. Sources close to the gallery report that the piping system has been contacted by some form of Mould branches inhabiting territory outside of our Institute’s premises. Again, there is no confirmation that the official leak was sent from this institution’s facilities.”[/i]
