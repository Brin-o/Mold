2: Welcome to WEAVE®-Help! My name is Horge, assistant to Dr. Jub Jubbard. What may we help you with today?
1: hi, the weave net connection in our office is weird
1: connecting to external orbs is not working
1: but the local orbs are ok
2: Aha, I see. Please give me a moment.
2: Ok.
2: I will need the Weave®INDENTIFIER of the WVDevice that you are using.
1: uhhh
1: ok
1: it’s the thing in the eye menu, right? 
2: Yes, that is correct. If you click on the eye in the top left, you should be able to see your WVDevice ID at the very top.
2: Below it, you will see convenient features and shortcuts to use on your system :)
1: ok

2: Thank you.
2: I will now remotely analyse your WVDevice.
2: Please give me a moment.
2: You might be disconnected from WV-Net in the meantime.
2: In case it fails to reconnect after 10 minutes, please call us on the currently relevant customer support number.
2: It should be written on the last page of the current (73rd) edition of the manual that was sent to you when the system was upgraded.
